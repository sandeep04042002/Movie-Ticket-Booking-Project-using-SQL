# Movie-Ticket-Booking-Project-using-SQL
A Movie Ticket Booking system uses SQL tables like theater, shows, customers, movies, payments, and booking to manage the entire process. The theater table stores cinema details, movies stores film information, and shows links movies with show timings. Customers and booking handle ticket reservations, while payments records transaction details.
